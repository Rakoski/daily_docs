# Day at work

## What I did

### Bugfixes

- Made a bugfix of duplicated exam managements. Basically in the frontend there was a button that if called twice
would duplicate a field in the db that couldn't happen. Fixed that

- Sustain: Helped a colleague of mine with a few support tickets he was getting stuck at.

### PRs

- Finished a report page of a feature we are creating, basically I had to create a separare button and added 
the APIs logic inside the component for simple use
